The collections that make up Modern Politics at the Rose Library document the birth of the Sunbelt South, and the politicians, individuals and organizations who shaped and created the South's contemporary political landscape. In this area, the Rose Library continues to develop its activist and political collections, particularly with the recent addition of the LGBT collection. Other strengths include the personal papers of the United States Senator, Sam Nunn and the United States Representatives, James C. Davis and James A. Mackay in addition to the papers of a broad range of political figures from Georgia politics.
