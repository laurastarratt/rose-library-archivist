Emory has collected manuscripts, archives and rare books related to Southern history for nearly 100 years. The Rose Library's collections are particularly strong in the history of the American Civil War and the history of the civil rights and post-civil rights eras. The Rose Library is also strong in research collections devoted to the social and cultural history of the American South, with a particular emphasis on Georgia and Atlanta. Areas of particular strength include: the Civil War, Methodism, journalism, Jewish history and culture. The Rose Library continues to build its holdings of books printed in the South, with the J. Durelle Boles Collection of Southern Imprints adding significant strength in this area.
